I&amp;rsquo;ve been a cottager in the area my entire life and am prepared, equipped, and ready to handle any project on the Bay.
My season generally lasts from mid-May until the end of September.
I offer, for every service, a firm, quoted price. I believe this is the fairest structure for both parties.</description></item><item><title>Insurance</title><link>https://cottagepainter.github.io/about/insurance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cottagepainter.github.io/about/insurance/</guid><description>Cottage Painter is fully insured by Lloyd&amp;rsquo;s through Martin Merry &amp;amp; Reid Limited.
