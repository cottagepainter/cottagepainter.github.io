painter, forming a trinity with the traditional methods of brushing and
rolling.</p><p>The main benefit of spraying is speed. A two-story house that used to

a brush, <a href=https://www.familyhandyman.com/painting/techniques/eliminate-paint-brush-marks/>lap marks</a>, caused by the bristles dragging out the paint, are
inevitably left behind and visible to the critical eye. Paint applied by
a roller leaves behind <a href=http://www.bykoket.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/for-contractors/roller-marks-or-stipple-paint-problem>stippling</a>, caused by the indent of the fibers on
the nap. Spraying, on the other hand, leaves behind no visible trace of
application. This makes spraying especially ideal when painting smooth
surfaces such as trim or doors.</p><p>Spraying is also ideal when dealing with non-flat surfaces like
furniture. Painting these with a brush or roller is extremely error
prone and can take a lot of work to get right. A piece of furniture that
takes 2 hours to brush can be sprayed in under 5 minutes!</p><p>For an excellent demonstration, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XrqsbEP75o">this video</a>.</p><ul>

Airless Sprayers
<a href=#top-of-page>
<i class="fa fa-caret-up" aria-hidden=true></i>
</a>
</h2><p>A paint sprayer, in general, must be capable of three things;
<strong>pumping</strong>, <strong>atomization</strong>, and <strong>patternification</strong>.</p><p>At its heart, a paint sprayer is a simple pump capable of moving
liquid material through a hose at variable pressure. Where sprayers
differ is in the process of <em>atomization</em>.</p><p>These droplets are then dispersed into the air. However, in order
for utter chaos to not ensue, the sprayer must emit the dispersion in a controlled fashion.</p><p>Different sprayers emit different patterns. However, most vary on the shape of an elongated oval.</p><p>The sprayers that I use are called <strong>airless sprayers</strong>. They get their name from how they atomize. Instead of pushing compressed air into the liquid paint, like other sprayers do, they use a combination of high pressure and special tips. Thus <em>airless</em>.</p><p>The advantage of using an airless sprayer is the ability to output large amounts of paint, making them ideal
for large-scale commercial use. Compressed air sprayers, while performing much finer atomization, cannot match the output
of an airless sprayer, making them less then ideal for large-scale projects, but more then ideal for extremely fine applications (like repainting cars).</p><h2 id=overspray>
Overspray
<a href=#top-of-page>

</a>
</h2><p>Although spraying is incredibly effective and efficient (and my favorite part of painting!), it does have its
own set of challenges. The biggest, and perhaps most infamous, is <em>overspray</em>.</p><p>Many reputations have been ruined by not taking the proper percautions against overspray. I take the
problem very seriously. With care and expertise, it can be controlled.</p><h3 id=what-causes-overspray?>
What causes overspray?
<a href=#overspray>
<i class="fa fa-caret-up" aria-hidden=true></i>
</a>
</h3><p>Overspray is inevitable when using a sprayer. Atomized paint reacts
with the environment to create an imperfect dispersion. Thus, instead
of hoping to eliminate overspray, we can control it by understanding its
nature and protecting the places we know it will go.</p><h3 id=controlling-overspray>

Understanding your Environment
<a href=#controlling%20overspray>
<i class="fa fa-caret-up" aria-hidden=true></i>
</a>
</h4><p>Paint emitted by a sprayer is dispersed as an atomized cloud. Understanding how this dispersion interacts with the environment
is crucial to controlling it.</p><p>Since atoms of paint have very small mass, they are easily carried
away by the wind. Being mindful of wind direction and speed
is the most important concern while spraying.
The wind determines the quantity and placement of your
<a href=../glossary#masking>masking</a>, as well as determining if it&rsquo;s even
feasible to spray at all.</p><p>Another crucial point to realize is that paint atoms have a large
surface area relative to their volume. This implies that any liquid
inside them will evaporate quickly. The speed at which this evaporation
takes place is governed by humidity and temperature. With
normal levels of humidity and temperature, it is a fact that most overspray dries
in the air quickly enough that it falls to the ground as harmless
dust. However, when humidity is high and temperature is low, the
dry time increases making overspray more of a threat. In these
scenarios, masking must be increased.</p><h4 id=understanding-your-equipment>
Understanding your Equipment
<a href=#controlling%20overspray>
<i class="fa fa-caret-up" aria-hidden=true></i>
</a>
</h4><p>A painter has varying control, via his sprayer, of the following parameters:</p><ul>
<li>Amount of paint emitted</li><li>Pressure</li><li>Size of the dispersion pattern</li><li>Size of the paint atoms</li></ul><p>Making sure each is tuned correctly relative to the paint being used, the current environment, and the nature of the surface,
helps to control overspray by minimizing the amount of it.</p><h4 id=catching>

Backbrushing
<a href=#top-of-page>
<i class="fa fa-caret-up" aria-hidden=true></i>
</a>
</h2><p>Paint applied with a sprayer exists as a layer on top of the
surface. When dealing with highly porous surfaces, like cedar or pine siding, it
cannot be expected that the paint will penetrate into the tiny holes
and grooves of the surface. Thus the sprayed-paint must be <strong>pushed</strong>
into those pores to guarantee proper adhesion. This process is called
<strong>backbrushing</strong> and is done with either a brush or a roller.</p><h3 id=is-it-always-necessary?>
Is it always necessary?
<a href=#backbrushing>
<i class="fa fa-caret-up" aria-hidden=true></i>
</a>
</h3><p><strong>No</strong>. If the surface is smooth, then there is no texture in the
surface to push the paint into. Backbrushing in this case would both
ruin your finish and waste your time.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer>
