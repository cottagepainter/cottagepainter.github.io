I require two numbers:

1. The **days** it will take to complete the job
2. The **gallons of paint** required

I don't do any fancy
measurements to figure them out, just my own gut-feeling tempered
with experience.  Once I have them, the estimated price is then derived.

I generate estimates with the [Invoice Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invoiceapp&hl=en_CA&gl=US) app and send them to the client either via email or text.

If the customer agrees to the estimate, a date is then scheduled to begin the painting
process.

The first step in the painting process, and arguably the most
important, is making sure that all surfaces are clean. Contaminants
on the deck (such as dirt, dust, mold, and mildew) directly
affect the ability of the paint to bond. The strength of the bond between the deck and stain
is what determines the stains's longevity.

I wash decks with a high-pressure (~3000psi) pressure washer
and a [rotating nozzle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZJfXY4LMcA) to maximize agitation. I don't use chemicals.

After pressure washing, I will spray any areas contaminated with mildew using 
[Concrobium Mold Control](https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/concrobium-mold-control-946-ml-0530811p.0530811.html?gclid=CjwKCAiA4rGCBhAQEiwAelVti1x28IFrc3Al761DVXhUAX2IE7XEDwjeTR8eN-PIm85sTftukxcrKRoCVaEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds#store=36).

The washing is typically scheduled a day or two before the main painting process. This is because the
surface must be allowed to completely dry before any more work can be done. The scheduling is
very flexible as the process, usually, doesn't take long to complete.

The deck must then be left to dry before continuing the process. 
Typically, on the Bay, oil-based products are used on decks. When this is the
case, the deck must be left to **completely** dry. With water-based products you can generally get away with some moisture in the wood.

The type of stain determines the type of prep required.

Solid-color stains are the simplest. In this case, generally all that is necessary is making sure loose coatings are scraped or sanded away. Solid-color stains
can generally be applied over an existing coating.

For the rest, heavy sanding is generally required. This is not only to remove the
previous coating, but also to bring the wood back to a pre-weathered state.

The stain is rolled on and then backbrushed. This, in my opinion, looks
better then just leaving it rolled on, plus the application will be more
thourough as bristles can sometimes push the stain into places a roller
cannot. 

The gaps between boards are stained as well. Leaving these unstained looks unprofessional. 
If its a bigger project i might opt to us an airless-spraying
to apply the stain on the sides and then backbrush it in.

{{< headerlink level="3" id="cleanup" parent="process" title="Cleanup" >}}

Once the staining is complete, I remove all my garbages, pack up my equipment,
and generally try to leave the place better looking then when I arrived.
