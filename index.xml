I&amp;rsquo;ve been a cottager in the area my entire life and am prepared, equipped, and ready to handle any project on the Bay.
My season generally lasts from mid-May until the end of September.
I offer, for every service, a firm, quoted price. I believe this is the fairest structure for both parties.</description></item><item><title>Exterior Painting</title><link>https://cottagepainter.github.io/services/exterior-painting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cottagepainter.github.io/services/exterior-painting/</guid><description>I offer modern, efficient, large-scale exterior painting.

Thus, caulking not only helps to insulate your buildings, but is also an important aesthetic process.
Flashing Light interacting differently with different parts of the same surface creates a discrepancy in it&amp;rsquo;s visual experience. Depending on the amount and direction of the light, flashing can be very [noticible](https://www.google.ca/?gws_rd=ssl#q=paint flashing&amp;amp;tbm=isch).</description></item><item><title>Spraying</title><link>https://cottagepainter.github.io/resources/spraying/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2019 11:40:14 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://cottagepainter.github.io/resources/spraying/</guid><description>Spraying is a basic method of paint-application for the modern painter, forming a trinity with the traditional methods of brushing and rolling.
The main benefit of spraying is speed. A two-story house that used to take 10 days to paint with a brush and roller, can be sprayed in 1 or 2 days by just one person. An incredible productivity boost!
Spraying also leaves the finest finish. Anytime paint is applied with a brush, lap marks, caused by the bristles dragging out the paint, are inevitably left behind and visible to the critical eye.</description></item><item><title>Equipment</title><link>https://cottagepainter.github.io/resources/equipment/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2019 11:40:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://cottagepainter.github.io/resources/equipment/</guid><description>Caulking Ladders Masking Spackling Spraying Washing Caulking After a couple years of testing, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that Big Stretch is the only caulk worth using. Although it is expensive (~$6.00 a tube), it works where the others failed. This is especially true on the Bay, where buildings are normally old, wooden, and very exposed.

People use the word &amp;lsquo;paint&amp;rsquo; for anything that you can put on with a brush, hence the verb &amp;rsquo;to paint&amp;rsquo;. The problem is that the &amp;lsquo;paint&amp;rsquo;-industry uses the word &amp;lsquo;paint&amp;rsquo; for a class of its products. It&amp;rsquo;s like a restaurant replacing the word &amp;rsquo;entree&amp;rsquo; with &amp;lsquo;food&amp;rsquo;. As a consequence, people end up calling different things &amp;lsquo;paint&amp;rsquo;, even thou they might differ greatly in function.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://cottagepainter.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cottagepainter.github.io/contact/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://cottagepainter.github.io/free-estimate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cottagepainter.github.io/free-estimate/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hiring</title><link>https://cottagepainter.github.io/hiring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cottagepainter.github.io/hiring/</guid><description>Looking for a summer job?
